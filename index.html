<p>Children's Learning Interactive Profile Stencils</p>

<p>Teachers are charged with carrying the most precious burden of shaping the future on an astoundingly low budget. Among the many daily tasks an important and personal assessment of the child's development is to be consolidated into a profile. The primary purpose of the profile is to inform the parents of their child's developmental strengths and weaknesses. </p>

<p>When reviewing a child, within the scaffolding of national standards, often teachers find themselves at an impasse. There are a number of factors (areas of observation) that need to be considered based on the child's age.</p>

<p>CLIPS will offer an outline of considerations that should be covered, while affording the opportunity to add and customize additional areas of observations. As a teacher selects the level of development for a particular student, a list of applicable general statements will be offered, with an online reference to specialized terminology. The generated statements will be general and are only meant to serve as an aid; a skeleton framework, which the teacher can then edit to a specific child. Similar to sitting in a think-tank bouncing ideas within a group of related professionals, CLIPS should serve only to assist and stimulate the considerations of the teacher writing the portfolios. Of course in the process of communicating to student's parents, one will wish to find balance between educational jargon and the local vernacular.</p>

<p>Every profile requires adding objects (work samples and observation records) to indicate work done in real-life situations with authentic problem solving. CLIPS will need to allow for inclusion of such custom objects.</p>

<h1>
<a id="notes" class="anchor" href="#notes" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>NOTES:</h1>

<h1>
<a id="initial-goals" class="anchor" href="#initial-goals" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Initial Goals:</h1>

<p>This is the formative phase of development, and even the code project name CLIPS is being reconsidered. In this phase, we are trying to map out the flow of the 'business logic' (viz. use cases). The immensity of all topics to cover is dauntingly large, and so to lay down the program's structure, we will focus first on 'Early childhood development', before adding additional groups.</p>

<h1>
<a id="exports" class="anchor" href="#exports" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Exports:</h1>

<p>We will need feedback for how users would want their data delivered; word documents, plain-text, exports to third-party cloud services such as LifeCubby.me, et cetera.</p>

<h1>
<a id="data-storage" class="anchor" href="#data-storage" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data Storage:</h1>

<p>It would be wise to at least store the data of the children, for at least the duration from start to finishing a particular portfolio. If one begins a student's portfolio, and is cut off during the ride home in the metro, you would not wish to loose all your work. Many countries now have regulations on how long personal data may be stored. These issues will have to be looked into on a per country basis.</p>

<h1>
<a id="platforms-and-integration" class="anchor" href="#platforms-and-integration" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Platforms and Integration:</h1>

<p>Initial implementation is currently envisioned as a browser based app and possibly an Android App. The first allows for the largest possible use, the second (Android) would provide for more secure, localized storage and data-transfer efficiency. During the development phase, we will also be evaluating how to incorporate CLIPS into existing educational projects such as Moogle.</p>

### Welcome to GitHub Pages.
This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:

```
$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
```

If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.

### Designer Templates
We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.

### Rather Drive Stick?
If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.

### Authors and Contributors
You can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.

### Support or Contact
Having trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at https://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.

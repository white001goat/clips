Among the many daily tasks an important and personal assessment of the child's development is to be consolidated into a profile. The primary purpose of the profile is to inform the parents of their child's developmental strengths and weaknesses. \r\n\r\nWhen reviewing a child, within the scaffolding of national standards, often teachers find themselves at an impasse. There are a number of factors (areas of observation) that need to be considered based on the child's age.\r\n\r\nCLIPS will offer an outline of considerations that should be covered, while affording the opportunity to add and customize additional areas of observations. As a teacher selects the level of development for a particular student, a list of applicable general statements will be offered, with an online reference to specialized terminology. The generated statements will be general and are only meant to serve as an aid; a skeleton frame work, which the teacher can then edit to a specific child. Similar to sitting in a think-tank bouncing ideas within a group of related professionals, CLIPS should serve only to assist and stimulate the considerations of the teacher writing the portfolios. Of course in the process of communicating to student's parents, one will wish to find balance between educational jargon and the local vernacular.\r\n\r\nEvery profile requires adding objects (work samples and observation records) to indicate work done in real-life situations with authentic problem solving. CLIPS will need to allow for inclusion of such custom objects.\r\n\r\n# NOTES:\r\n\r\n# Initial Goals: \r\nThis is the formative phase of development, and even the code project name CLIPS is being reconsidered. In this phase, we are trying to map out the flow of the 'business logic' (viz. use cases). The immensity of all topics to cover is dauntingly large, and so to lay down the program's structure, we will focus first on 'Early childhood development', before adding additional groups.\r\n\r\n# Exports:\r\nWe will need feedback for how users would want their data delivered; word documents, plain-text, exports to third-party cloud services such as LifeCubby.me, et cetera.\r\n\r\n# Data Storage:\r\nIt would be wise to at least store the data of the children, for at least the duration from start to finishing a particular portfolio. If one begins a student's portfolio, and is cut off during the ride home in the metro, you would not wish to loose all your work. Many countries now have regulations on how long personal data may be stored. These issues will have to be looked into on a per country basis.\r\n\r\n# Platforms and Integration:\r\nInitial implementation is currently envisioned as a browser based app and possibly an Android App. The first allows for the largest possible use, the second (Android) would provide for more secure, localized storage and data-transfer efficiency. During the development phase, we will also be evaluating how to incorporate CLIPS into existing educational projects such as Moogle.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
